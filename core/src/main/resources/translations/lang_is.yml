# All messages sent in game by this plugin are stored here (and in the future in other files for other languages as well).
# This file should not be edited directly, but instead used as a reference for writing message overrides in
#   `language-settings.yml`.
# All messages will have a brief description, and an explanation of what each placeholder represents.
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# For when an RTP action is denied such as trying to rtp in a world that does not allow rtp.
#   {0} - The reason the action was denied.
not-permitted-generic: 'Gat ekki teleportað af handahófi útaf: {0}'
# For when an RTP action is denied because an issue occurred. Ex: an exception occurs while waiting for an rtp location.
#   {0} - The message from the exception that caused this message to appear.
#   Note: This is always followed in console by a stack trace (which can not be configured)
not-permitted-major-error: 'Villa. Gat ekki teleportað af handahófi útaf: {0} \nVinsamlegast lýtið í stjórnborðið fyrir nákvæmar upplýsingar fyrir afhverju teleportið gekk ekki upp.'
# For when the reason an action is denied is that rtp is not enabled in the world.
#   {0} - An identifier that helps with debugging
not-enabled-in-this-world: 'Teleport af handahófi er ekki virkt í þessum heimi. {0}'
# For no rtpSettings are found with a given name
#   {0} - The given name
no-settings-found-with-name: 'Engin handahófs teleport stilling fundin með þessu nafni {0}'
# For no rtpSettings are found with a given name WHEN SEARCHED BY A SPECIFIC PLAYER
# This will both be displayed when the rtpSettings with the given name do not exist, or the player who ran
#   the `/rtp <settingsName>` command did not have permission to use the settings found.
#   {0} - The given name
no-settings-found-with-name-for-player: 'Engin handahófs teleport stilling fundin með þessu nafni {0}'
# For when too many attempts are made by the plugin to find a point with no success.

# For any time the plugin expects a player's name but does not receive the name of a player.
#   {0} - The name given that did not match a player.
player-not-found: 'Gat ekki fundið spilara {0}'
# For when a world name is expected but not received.
#   {0} - The given name that matched no world names.
world-not-found: 'Gat ekki fundið heim {0}'
cooldown-over: 'Your RTP cooldown for "{0}" is over.'
# For when a given rtpSettings is expected to contain the given world, but does not.
#   {0} - The rtpSetting's name
#   {1} - The world's name
rtp-settings-no-contain-world: 'Instillingar misræmi teleport af handahófi stilling "{0}" inniheldur ekki heimi "{1}" sem virkum heimi.'
# For when a given rtpSettings can only land people in one world but another world is requested instead.
#   {0} - The rtpSetting's name
#   {1} - The only valid world name
rtp-settings-must-use-world: 'Instillingar misræmi teleport af handahófi stilling "{0}" getur bara teleportað fólk í heimi "{1}"'
# For when a player needs to wait for a cooldown before running the command again.
#   {0} - The cooldown time (uses READABLE-TIME as defined below)
need-to-wait-for-cooldown: 'Þarf að bíða eftir niðurfellingartíma: {0}'
# READABLE-TIME - This is a special case message. Whenever a time needs to be displayed, it will use this for
#   formatting. Also, each 'word' will only be displayed if the associated number value is greater than 0.
# Example: 8675 seconds will be formatted as such: `2 hours, 24 minutes, 35 seconds.` Note the absence of days.
readable-time: '{0}{1}{2}{3}'
readable-time-word-days: '{0} dagar, '
readable-time-word-hours: '{0} klukkutímar, '
readable-time-word-minutes: '{0} mínútur, '
readable-time-word-seconds: '{0} sekúndur.'
